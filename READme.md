## Fun Translate
This is a translation web application. The thing that makes it INTERESTING, is the fact that one doesn't do the normal language- language translation.
It translates "Normal English" to let's say, oldenglish, like the one SHAKESPEARE used. FUn right? I am sure you are a little curious about how certain phrases would sound if we were in another era.
Have fun with this project.
